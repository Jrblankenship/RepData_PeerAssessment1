## Loading packages  
Several packages beyond the base packages will be required to run this analysis. Make sure Lubridate, dplyr, ggplot2, and mice are downloaded before running the code. This code will load in the programs (I have hidden the progress messages).
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(mice)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data  
The following code will import the CSV data into the "activity" dataframe and transform the dates in the file into time variables using the lubridate package. The file was originally downloaded from the course website (2-5-2021 at 3:00 PM Central Time) and stored in a file on my computer. The lubridate processing will not alter the actual dates, but will make them plottable as dates in R.
```{r loadtransform}
activity <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coursera/data/activity.csv")
activity$date <- ymd(activity$date)
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?   
Our first question is to calculate the total number of steps taken per day. Here, we plot this as a histogram. It is important to note that we are missing a number of values throughout the dataset.
```{r total_steps}
total <- activity %>%
          group_by(date) %>%
          summarise(total_steps = sum(steps)) #This groups the steps by day and calculates the total steps for each day
ggplot(total) + geom_histogram(aes(x = date, weight = total_steps), color = "black", bins = 61)
#this makes a histogram of the number of steps by study date.
```

Second, we are interested in the average and median number of steps taken per day. The code used to calculate this is below and i have used backticks to push R into inserting the values below.
```{r meanmedian}
totalmean <- mean(total$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE); totalmed <- median(total$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The median number of steps per day is `r totalmean` and the median number of steps per day is `r totalmed`.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?  
For this question, we first focus on plotting the average steps during each 5 minute interval recorded during the day. 
```{r daily activity}
daily <- activity %>%
            group_by(interval) %>%
            summarise(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE)) #Very similar to the code above, but now grouped by interval and looking at the mean instead of the total
plot(x= daily$interval, y = daily$average_steps, type = "l", xlab = "Time Interval", ylab = "Average Steps", main = "Steps during daily 5 minute intervals")
```


```{r max}
maxinterval <- daily$interval[which.max(daily$average_steps)]
```
What time interval averages the most steps? From the plot, we could give an eyeball estimate, or we could get all mathy about it and identify the definite time interval with the most average steps per day. The code is above and I have used backticks to fill in the value below. The five minute interval with the most average daily activity is `r maxinterval`.

## Imputing missing values  
```{r missing values}
missing <-sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```
We know there are missing values in our dataset (if you head(df) the original file, the "steps" are all 'NA'). The code above shows us that there are `r missing` missing values in the original dataset.

### Where are the NA's?  
While this wasn't asked, I was interested in figuring out where the NA values were, in regards to the intervals of the day.
```{r interval missing}
intmiss <- activity$interval[is.na(activity$steps)]
table(intmiss)
```
The purpose of this exercise was determine if missing values clustered at a certain time period. If they were, averaging by day might skew answers inappropriately. The table showed that the missing values were equally distributed over all time intervals (8 each), which suggests that a variety of strategies of imputing would be fine for filling in the missing data. I perhaps should have looked at whether there was skew to the days the data was missing, but the weekday/weekend pattern was not apparent until the end of the exercise.

### Filling in the missing values  
The following code uses the mice package to impute the missing data. It's using the default missing data method, pmm, or 'predictive mean matching'. It appears to be commonly used for imputing missing values, but is not perfect. 
```{r imputing missing values, results='hide'}
totalimp <- activity 
totalimp$steps <- as.numeric(totalimp$steps) #makes the step variable a numeric variable
totalimp <- mice(totalimp, m = 5, maxit = 50, method = "pmm", seed = 500) #imputes data using predictive mean matching to fill in the missing data (m=5 gives 5 possibilities)
comtotalimp <- complete(totalimp, 5) #resets the dataframe using the second impute possibility (any would do)
head(comtotalimp)
```

### Total steps per day  
We will now look at the imputed "complete" data, making a histogram, which can be compared to original histogram above.  
```{r imputed daily histogram}
imputed <- comtotalimp %>%
          group_by(date) %>%
          summarise(total_steps = sum(steps))
ggplot(imputed) + geom_histogram(aes(x = date, weight = total_steps), color = "black", bins = 61)
```
Fewer days are missing, but we do still see days with very few steps. Perhaps a different imputation method would have been more effective.  

We are interested in how the mean and median are impacted by the imputed data. The code is shown below, and I have pushed R fill in the values below.
```{r meanmediancomp}
meanimputed <- mean(imputed$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE); medimputed <- median(imputed$total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The median number of steps per day is `r meanimputed` and the median number of steps per day is `r medimputed`. These values are both lower than the non-imputed values (mean - `r totalmean`, median - `r totalmed`). Given the even spread of missing values, this suggests that the imputation strategy may not have been the most ideal. Based on the weekday/weekend trends, if missing data was skewed towards either weekend or weekday timepoints, this would likely impact our ability to impute data correctly.

# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?  
We first need to add a column to our dataframe that marks whether days are weekdays or weekends.
```{r addingwkdy}
wkdy <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") #a vector of weekdays
comtotalimp$day <- factor((weekdays(comtotalimp$date) %in% wkdy), levels = c(TRUE, FALSE), labels = c("weekday", "weekend")) #matches the label to the weekday/weekend based on a logical assessment comparing to the wkdy vector
head(comtotalimp)
```

And now we want to look at how activity varies between weekend and weekday days. We can see clear variations in the patterns. On weekdays, there is an early peak of activity, but for the most part, steps vary between 25-75 for a large part of the day. Activity started later on weekends, but was overall higher for the rest of the day, with steps varying between 25 and 150 for that time period.
```{r stepsweekday, message=FALSE}
wkdystep <- comtotalimp %>%
        group_by(interval, day) %>%
        summarise(average_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(data = wkdystep, aes(interval, average_steps)) + geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) +geom_point(color = "black") + labs(title = "Average steps", y = "Steps", x = "Time interval") + facet_wrap(~day)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
